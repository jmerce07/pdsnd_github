### Project Title
U.S. Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
The purpose of this project is to use Python to create an interactive interface to explore data collected from bike share systems for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington). The program imports the data for one of the cities and computes some summary statistics. Users will be able to input responses for prompted questions that will tell them about the bikeshare data for that city by month or a weekday. Feel free to contribute to the project or use my program as starter code to create your own!
